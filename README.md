# Dodge the Creeps! 

This was made by following the Godot tutorial "Your first 2D game" at https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html (Link working as of 09/19/2025). 

I made a couple of modifications on top of the tutorial: 
  - Added more controls:
    - WASD for movement, Space to start a game
    - You can still use arrow keys for movement and enter to start as well
  - Added a new enemy type, the **Hunter**
    - Only one per map
    - Spawns at a set location (instead of random)
    - Continuously tracks the player (instead of moving in a random line)
    - Visually the same
    - Touching it results in a Game Over still.
